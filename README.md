#Your Shiny Application

    Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
    Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
    Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
    Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

#The application must include the following:

    Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
    Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
    Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
    You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
    The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.  

##My App: [https://srikanthguhan.shinyapps.io/Shiny]  

##Name: Chi-Square to P-value Calculator  

##What it does:  This calculator will tell you the one-tailed (right-tail) probability value for a chi-square test  

(i.e., the area under the chi-square distribution from the chi-square value to positive infinity), given the chi-square value and the degrees of freedom.
